The purpose of this project was to develop an application that allows users to see how their investments will grow over time.

What did you do particularly well?
I feel like I fulfilled the requirements of the project well and ensured that the program ran smoothly with accurate results. 

Where could you enhance your code? How would these improvements make your code more efficient, secure, and so on?
I feel like I could have made my code more neat and organized to make it easier to read and run faster.

Which pieces of the code did you find most challenging to write, and how did you overcome this? What tools or resources are you adding to your support network?
Learning to create different files that had to work together was very difficult. I used YouTube videos to help learn this.
